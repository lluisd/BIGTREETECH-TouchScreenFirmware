### Marlin Firmware Variants

Four different Marlin fw variants are available:

- **Standard**: Standard version (no BLTouch, no bed leveling support)
- **MBL**: Standard version + MBL suppport (Manual Mesh Bed Leveling)
- **BLTouch Waggster Mod**: It supports BLTouch connected to LED cable (Waggster method). LED on printer is no more available
- **BLTouch Standard**: It supports BLTouch connected to Marlin mainboard. LED on printer is still available and usable. See pictures for cabling and connection guide in the zip file provided in the download page. I used an FDD cable and crimped the connectors by myself. However, it is suggested (it requires less time) to use the 2 meters (1.5 meters is too short) optional cable sold for BLTouch

<a name="BLTouch-Support-and-Probe-Offset-Setup"></a>

#### BLTouch Support and Probe Offset Setup

Both the **BLTouch Standard** and **BLTouch Waggster Mod** fw variants are configured for the BLTouch support linked in the download page requiring probe offset `{28, -33, 0}`. In case a different support is used by the user, it is simply needed to change and save to EEPROM the value for the **Probe Offset** setting listed on TFT menu **Menu->Settings->Machine->Parameter**.

The download page provides two BLTouch supports requiring the following probe offset:

- `{28, -33, 0}`: New support used since Marlin fw 2.0.9.2
- `{33, -33, 0}`: Old support used until Marlin fw 2.0.9.1

## Firmware Compatibility

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Compatibility"></a>

### TFT Firmware Compatibility

The TFT fw is ready to be flashed on both Sidewinder X1 / X2 and Genius printers. So, no need to recompile the TFT fw is required. Only one change in configuration file is required for Genius (e.g. print volume).

**NOTE:** Latest Sidewinder X2 are equipped with a TFT based on GD32F305 chipset. The TFT fw provided here is **NOT** compatible with that chipset yet.

<a name="TFT-Firmware-for-Genius"></a>

#### TFT Firmware for Genius

To use the TFT fw on Genius:

1. Set the following parameter in TFT's configuration file `config.ini` with the build volume of the Genius:

   - `size_max:X220 Y220 Z250`

2. Load on TFT the updated configuration file `config.ini`

<a name="Marlin-Firmware-Dependencies"></a>

### Marlin Firmware Compatibility

All the 4 Marlin fw variants reported on section [Marlin Firmware Variants](#Marlin-Firmware-Variants) are ready to be flashed on Sidewinder X1 printer. Small changes are required for Genius (e.g. print volume). While Sidewinder X2 has a totally different mainboard and it's not compatible at all with the Marlin fw provided here.

<a name="Marlin-Firmware-for-Genius"></a>

#### Marlin Firmware for Genius

The 4 Marlin fw variants can be easily adapted to Genius printer but it needs to recompile the fw (e.g. with MS vscode).

To use the Marlin fw on Genius:

1. Install **MS Visual Studio Code** compiler on your PC / laptop
2. Install the extension **PlatformIO IDE 2.3.2** or above on vscode
3. Open the fw source project reported on section [Marlin Firmware](#Marlin-Firmware) with vscode:

   1. Set the following settings in source file `Marlin-2.0.x\Marlin\Configuration.h` with the build volume of the Genius:

      - `X_BED_SIZE 220`
      - `Y_BED_SIZE 220`
      - `Z_MAX_POS 250`

   2. Recompile the fw (to compile, simply press the keys `CTRL-ALT-B` at the same time)

4. Flash on the printer the created fw file `Marlin-2.0.x\.pio\build\mega2560\firmware.hex`

<a name="Integration-with-OctoPrint"></a>

## Integration with OctoPrint

The serial bus with the mainboard **MKS GEN L v1.0** is shared between TFT and OctoPrint / ESP3D / Pronterface etc. This means that printing from OctoPrint causes Marlin to receive gcodes from OctoPrint and TFT at the same time (there are collisions). This will let Marlin reply with error messages, that will be displayed on both OctoPrint and TFT display, such as:

    Line Number is Not Last Line Number +1 Last Line 1686

In order to avoid the problem, when printing with OctoPrint etc. put the TFT in **Listening Mode** pressing on TFT button **Menu->Settings->Connection->ON**.

**NOTES:**

- This limitation is not due to bugs on the TFT firmware but it's an hardware limitation on MKS GEN L v1.0 mainboard
- Listening Mode state is stored on FLASH allowing to restore the mode at TFT startup. This allows to power on/off the printer remotely and to control the printer via USB without the need of any touch (from the user) on the display to engage the mode

<a name="Printing-from-Remote-Host"></a>

### Printing from Remote Host

After the TFT is set to Listening Mode (see section [Integration with OctoPrint](#Integration-with-OctoPrint)),
OctoPrint, ESP3D, Pronterface etc, connected to a TFT's or mainboard's serial port, can host a print (print handled by the host) and optionally can trigger some actions to the TFT sending specific G-codes. The following actions and the related triggering G-codes are currently supported by the TFT fw:

| **ACTION**                  | **G-CODE**                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **start**                   | `M118 P0 A1 action:print_start`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **end**                     | `M118 P0 A1 action:print_end`                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **cancel**                  | `M118 P0 A1 action:cancel`                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **pause**                   | `M118 P0 A1 action:pause`                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **resume**                  | `M118 P0 A1 action:resume`                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **remaining time progress** | `M118 P0 A1 action:notification Time Left <XX>h<YY>m<ZZ>s`<br>or<br>`M117 Time Left <XX>h<YY>m<ZZ>s`<br><br>Examples:<br>`M118 P0 A1 action:notification Time Left 02h04m06s`<br>`M117 Time Left 02h04m06s` |
| **print layer progress**    | `M118 P0 A1 action:notification Layer Left <XXXX>/<YYYY>`<br>or<br>`M117 Layer Left <XXXX>/<YYYY>`<br><br>Examples:<br>`M118 P0 A1 action:notification Layer Left 51/940`<br>`M117 Layer Left 51/940`       |
| **file data progress**      | `M118 P0 A1 action:notification Data Left <XXXX>/<YYYY>`<br>or<br>`M117 Data Left <XXXX>/<YYYY>`<br><br>Examples:<br>`M118 P0 A1 action:notification Data Left 123/12345`<br>`M117 Data Left 123/12345`     |

When the trigger `print_start` is received, the TFT switches to **Printing** menu.
When the trigger `print_end` or `cancel` is received, the TFT Printing menu is finalized (statistics available etc.).
When on Printing menu, pressing on the **pause**, **resume** and **stop** buttons will trigger to the remote host the following notifications, respectively:

| **NOTIFICATION**            | **ACK MESSAGE**                       |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **pause**                   | `//action:notification remote pause`  |
| **resume**                  | `//action:notification remote resume` |
| **cancel**                  | `//action:notification remote cancel` |

The remote host must properly handle the received notifications. For example, if `//action:notification remote pause` is received then the remote host must effectively pause the print and send `M118 P0 A1 action:pause` in order to trigger the pause action to the TFT.

**NOTES:**
- A new plugin on OctoPrint implementing the above protocol should be the preferable way (available to everyone)

### TFT Firmware Update

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Installation"></a>

#### TFT Firmware Installation

In order to install the TFT firmware:

1. Download the firmware
2. Unzip the archive and copy the contents to the SD Card. The folder `TFT28` and file `MKSTFT28.bin` must be on the root folder of the SD card
3. Plug in the SD card into the printer
4. Turn on the printer and wait for the firmware to finish flashing
5. In case calibration procedure is started, touch the calibration points on the screen
6. Restart the printer
7. Proceed with the configuration as reported on section [TFT Firmware Configuration](#TFT-Firmware-Configuration)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
Always install all the content provided in the zip file. That means, copy in the SD card the `.bin` + `config.ini` + `TFT28` folder with its files.
In addition (optional) also the desired `language_xx.ini` file can be provided in the root folder of the SD card. All the language files are found in the `Language_Packs` folder.

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Configuration"></a>

#### TFT Firmware Configuration

To update the TFT firmware configuration:

1. Edit the settings in `config.ini`. See the comments on the file to properly set each setting
2. Copy the `config.ini` file to the root folder of the SD card. (The SD card capacity should be less than or equal to 8GB and formatted as FAT32)
3. Insert the SD card in the TFT's SD card slot and restart the TFT by pressing the reset button (if you have a Sidewinder X1 v4 or above printer revision) or switching off and on the printer
4. The TFT will load the configuration from `config.ini` file and store it on internal SPI flash. That means the configuration will be loaded from SPI flash on all the next printer reboots (no need to provide the configuration file on the SD card unless you make changes on `config.ini` file and want to load the new configuration)

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Reset---Recalibration"></a>

#### TFT Firmware Reset - Recalibration

Sometimes, after a TFT firmware installation, the firmware can need a reset / recalibration in order to properly boot up.

In order to reset / recalibrate the TFT:

1. Create an empty file named `reset.txt`
2. Copy the `reset.txt` file to the root folder of the SD card. (The SD card capacity should be less than or equal to 8GB and formatted as FAT32)
3. Insert the SD card in the TFT's SD card slot and restart the TFT by pressing the reset button (if you have a Sidewinder X1 v4 or above printer revision) or switching off and on the printer
4. The TFT will start the recalibration process. Simply follow and complete the process. After completion, the TFT firmware should be properly booted up

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Not-Attached"></a>

#### TFT Firmware Not Attached

If the text:

    No printer attached!

is displayed on top of the display it means you need to change the value for the **UART speed** setting. By default it is set to **250000**. Change it from TFT menu **Menu->Settings->Connection->S. Ports**, wait few seconds in order to check that with the selected UART speed the error message disappears. Once the message disappears it means that the TFT firmware is now connected to the printer and you can use it.

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Rollback"></a>

#### TFT Firmware Rollback

In case you have issues with this custom firmware or you don't like it, you can rollback to the firmware previously installed in your printer.

In order to rollback:

1. Download the stock Artillery TFT firmware (from https://artillery3d.com) or any other custom TFT firmware you had previously installed in your printer
2. Unzip the archive and copy the contents to the SD Card. The contents must be on the root folder of the SD card
3. Plug in the SD card into the printer
4. Turn on the printer and wait for the firmware to finish flashing
5. Restart the printer

<a name="Marlin-Firmware-Update"></a>

### Marlin Firmware Update

<a name="Marlin-Firmware-Installation"></a>

#### Marlin Firmware Installation

On Sidewinder X1 and Genius printers, the mainboard's USB port used to connect the printer to a PC (e.g. to OctoPrint) is wired to a serial bus. This bus is also shared by both TFT and mainboard. The sharing of the serial bus does not allow to easily flash Marlin firmware due to collisions in the bus.

Two possible solutions were normally adopted to allow Marlin firmware updates:

1. Physical disconnection of the TFT serial cable so the serial bus is no more shared with the TFT. This solution requires to remove the cover under the chassis and possibly to loose any warrenty
2. Use a script under Linux OS trying to lock the serial bus to the TFT

This TFT firmware provides a third, and easy to use, solution for flashing Marlin firmware.

In order to flash Marlin firmware, follow the steps below in the same order they are reported:

1. Switch on the printer from the main power button (on the back of the printer)
2. From the TFT, press on button **Menu->Settings->Connection->Disconnect**. A black background with a text asking to touch the screen to connect again the TFT is prompted. **DO NOT** press on the display, so the TFT will continue to be disconnected from the serial bus
3. From the PC, open the application you usually use for flashing Marlin firmware (e.g. PrusaSlicer)
4. Plug a USB cable from the PC to the mainboard's USB port and connect the application to the printer
5. Follow the instructions provided by your application to flash Marlin firmware
6. Once Marlin firmware is flashed, disconnect the application from the printer and restart the printer (switching off and on or pressing on the TFT's reset button if you have a Sidewinder X1 v4)

<a name="Marlin-Firmware-Configuration"></a>

#### Marlin Firmware Configuration

After a new Marlin firmware is installed (see section [Marlin Firmware Installation](#Marlin-Firmware-Installation)), EEPROM must always be reset and the following setups have to be performed again and saved to EEPROM after completion:

1. Reset EEPROM, from **Menu->Settings->Machine->EEPROM->Reset** button
2. Perform **PID** process, from **Menu->Settings->Machine->Tuning->PID** menu
3. Perform **Probe Offset** process (only for BLTouch Marlin firmware versions), from **Menu->Movement->Bed Level->P Offset** menu
4. Perform **Bed Leveling** process, from **Menu->Movement->Bed Level->UBL** (or MBL) menu
5. Save to EEPROM, from **Menu->Settings->Machine->EEPROM->Save** button

## History of Changes

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Changes"></a>

### TFT Firmware Changes

- 1.27.x Patch 9.3, January 12 2023

- 1.27.x Patch 9.2, August 10 2022

- 1.27.x Patch 9.1, May 23 2022

  **BUG FIXES:**
  - Fixed missing display of probe values in LevelCorner menu when start button was used: In case the start button was used, only the value for the last point was properly displayed (for the first three points, values were not updated)

- 1.27.x Patch 9, May 09 2022

  **BUG FIXES:**
  - Fixed bug on wrong filament runout detection at print start
  - Fixed many other bugs

  **IMPROVEMENTS / NEW FEATURES:**
  - Improved GUI performance
  - Improved many other features
  - Some cleanup

- 1.27.x Patch 8, January 04 2022
  - Added Event LED feature: A new param "event_led" was added in "config.ini" (and also available on Feature menu) to enable Event LED feature. If enabled and when printing from TFT SD / TFT U Disk, during heating the TFT periodically sets the printer's (neopixel) LED color and TFT's knob LED color, if any, according to the current nozzle and bed temperatures.
  - Configurable suppression (hide) for common gcode file extension: new param "filename_extension" added in config.ini. If set to 0 (false), any file extension starting with ".g" or ".G" (e.g. ".g", ".gco", ".gcode" etc.) will be hidden in both List Mode / Icon Mode menu. That setting can also be changed from Screen->UI menu
  - Fixed incorrect sort order of files on USB/SD: The order of files shown on the display does not match the "Newest First" file order.
  - Fixed missing thumbnails while browsing icon list
  - Minor bug fixes and optimization

- 1.27.x Patch 7, November 25 2021
  - Fixed bugs on navigation menu in Print menu: ListMode was affected by a twice redrawn scrolling up/down. Title bar was also wrongly updated causing an avoidable flickering and lost of Temperature info (if enabled) on both icon/list mode
  - Fixed type for param "pl_recovery_z_raise" in config.ini. It was wrongly defined as integer type while it was then used as float type
  - Fixed TFT freeze due to permanent read/write error printing from SD slot: functions disk_read / disk_write in diskio.c performed a loop invoking SD_Init function. The loop was never terminated in case of a persistent error
  - Fixed MinX/MinY Leveling Distance: The origin of the bed is never less than 0. A negative minX/minY indicates the distance of the bed from endstops and must not be considered to determine the four leveling edges in Manual Leveling menu and Leveling Corner menu
  - Other fixes
  - Updated clock for MKS TFT: MKS TFT (based on STM32F10X_CL) supports 72MHz (as all the others TFT based on STM32F10X). Previous clock for MKS TFT was 48MHz
  - Update corner/manual levelling icons (by BTT)
  - Update ASCII font for TFT24/28 to be slightly taller and easy to read (by BTT)
  - Configurable Gcode file comment parsing feature: This previously hidden feature can now be enabled/disabled in config.ini (with param name "file_comment_parsing") and also in Feature menu. This gives visibility/control of the feature so it can be used according to the used slicer (e.g. Cura) and/or user preference.
    If enabled, the current implementation parses and processes print time and print layer information from the G-code file (nothing else).
    If disabled, the "layer_disp_type" setting provided in "UI Settings" section in config.ini becomes redundant.
  - Optimized loopPrintFromTFT function in Printing.c API: The parsing of each line in the gcode file is now split in order to speed up both the gcode parsing and the comment (if any) parsing
  - Added error handling and error notification in loopPrintFromTFT function in Printing.c API: The error handling function handleDiskError currently implemented forces a device re-initialization for a maximum number of retry attempts. If maximum number of retry is reached a print abort is forced. Previously, in case of error the file position (infoPrinting.cur) was never updated causing an infinite print loop (the print could never reach the end due to a permanent error reading from file)
  - Unified name for Controller Fan Active: Id for Active PWD in config.ini (CtL) was not matching the Id displayed in the menus (CtS) and its meaning (Active). The name was unified to CtA on both config.ini and menus
  - Implemented OctoPrint support
  - Some cleanup

- 1.27.x Patch 6, October 26 2021
  - Fixed (by BTT) a bug on Numpad menu causing wrong menu redraw on exit.

- 1.27.x Patch 5, September 23 2021
  - Added TFT Listening Mode: The TFT simply listen for ACK messages (e.g. spontaneous) while all the outgoing messages are purged.
    This mode is useful on main boards sharing the bus with TFT and USB (e.g. MKS GEN L) allowing OctoPrint/Pronterface to properly control the printer (via USB) avoiding command collisions (otherwise present with TFT in normal mode).
    The TFT will receive the ACK messages (spontaneous and/or related to gcodes from USB port) displaying on the screen all the status info.
    The mode can be activated/deactivated on "Connection" menu. Existing labels (ON/OFF) and icon have been used to avoid to add new ones
  - Fixed a freeze on Terminal menu caused by some texts

  **NOTE:** The mode state is stored on FLASH allowing to restore the mode at startup. This allows to power on/off the printer remotely and to control the printer via USB without the need of any touch (from the user) on the display to engage the mode

- 1.27.x Patch 4, September 9 2021
  - Configurable serial ports:
  - Added new param "serial_port" (it replaces "multi_serials") in config.ini allowing to set also the baudrate for each port. Each port can be configured with the proper baudrate (e.g. 125000 for Marlin, 500000 for ESP etc.)
  - Added "S ports" menu under "Connection" menu allowing to set each port at runtime. It allows to disable/change baudrate for each port when needed (e.g. when a device is plugged in the serial port)
  - Configurable feature "Emulated M109 / M190": New param "emulated_m109_m190" added in config.ini to enable/disable M109/M190 emulated with M104/M140. Set "emulated_m109_m190" to "0" to use M109/M190 and EVENT_LEDS
  - Added feature "Emulated M109 / M190" in Feature menu allowing to switch to M109/M190 <-> M104/M140 at runtime (no need to use config.ini)

## List of Main Features

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Main-Features"></a>

### TFT Firmware Main Features

- config.ini: a configuration file to set all the settings and features of the TFT firmware such as:
  - build volume (e.g. 300x300x400 for Sidewinder X1 or 220x220x250 for Genius printer)
  - number of tools, extruder and fans
  - max temperatures for all heaters
  - custom gcodes
  - default speeds
  - colours
  - etc.
- MBL (Mesh Bed Leveling) menu to perform MBL (it requires MBL enabled in Marlin fw)
- Mesh Editor and Mesh Tuner menus providing a visual mesh grid (gradient colors are configurable in config.ini) and a fine tune tool for mesh editing. The Mesh Editor supports:
  1. MBL
  2. UBL
  3. ABL Bilinear
- Notifications history menu. Open it by clicking on the screen top area (title bar).
- M600 support when printing from external onboard SD card (an SD card reader mounted on the main board)
- Tuning menu: a menu collecting all the typical printer calibration tools such as:
  - PID autotune: you can set the target temperatues for both the bed and the hotend and then start the autotune. Autotune is performed for all the heaters for which a temperature different than 0 was set. E.g. if you set the temperature only for bed, the autotune will be performed only for the bed
  - 100m extrusion: the classic 100mm of filament extrusion to calculate the correct steps-per-unit value
  - ABL e Manual leveling menu
  - parameter menu: the menu were you can set printer parameters (e.g. the correct steps-per-unit value you determined with the 100mm extrusion)
  - Terminal menu: to send any gcode to Marlin firmware
  - save button: it makes permanent on the EEPROM (it requires EEPROM is enabled on Marlin firmware) the setting provided on the Tuning menu. E.g. if you want to save PID values or babystep changes, don't forget to press this button otherwise you will loose those settings on next printer reboot
- Added a Connection menu collecting connection tools such as:
  - UART speed (baudrate): speed value to connect the TFT to Marlin firmware
  - disconnect button: used to temporary disconnect the TFT from Marlin firmware. It is usefull to allow flashing Marlin firmware without the need to open the printer chassis to disconnect the TFT cable from the main motherboard. E.g. you can use the Prusaslicer's firmware update tool to flash Marlin firmware
  - shut down button: used to shut down the printer (it requires the feature is enabled on Marlin firmware)
- Manual bed leveling menu:
  - added 5th leveling point: a center point is added
  - added XY Offset menu: it allows to set the edge distance of the four leveling points. An unlock button is also provided to unlock the X and Y axis (it allows to freely move the hotend along the bed)
- Auto bed leveling menu: it requires that feature is also enabled in Marlin firwmare (e.g. Waggster fw)
- Improved Z Offset menu. Now nozzle is moved every time z offset is changed so, using a paper, it is possible to evaluate the proper z offset
- BabyStep menu: available during printing
- Preheat menu: PLA, PETG and ABS buttons available. they can be applied to bed, nozzle or both. A button to cool down the selected heatear was also added
- Gcode menu: you can type any gcode command towards Marlin firmware. If an output is provided by the underliying Marlin firmware it will be shown on the display
- Custom gcode menu: load EEPROM (M501), reset to stock Marlin firmware (M502), Save on EEPROM (M500), disable steppers etc. are provided. It requires EEPROM is also enabled in Marlin firwmare (e.g. Waggster,  Robscar fw)
- Machine menu: it allows to see and modify settings such as steps-per-unit, max feed rate, max acceleration, Z probe etc.
- Feature menu: it allows to customize printer feature such as runot filament (on, off, smart), auto shut down after print (it requires it is enabled on Marlin firmware), file menu view (icon or list view mode) etc.
- more...

- decreased values for DEFAULT_MAX_FEEDRATE compared to default values provided by Artillery
- increased values for DEFAULT_ACCELERATION compared to default values provided by Artillery
- disabled "Junction Deviation" (enabled "Classic Jerk")
- disabled "S-Curve Acceleration"
Both the above disabled two parameters provide better results on Sidewinder X1 and do not interfere with Linear Advance feature
- enabled BLTouch. Probe offsets configured to X33 Y33. The proper support (STL file) is provided in the zip file
- enabled "Probe Repeatability Test" to use M48 gcode
- enabled "ABL Bilinear"
- enabled "Restore Leveling After G28" to restore saved leveling data after every G28 gcode execution
- enabled "Z Safe Homing"
- enabled "EEPROM Settings" to allow persistent storage to preserve configurable settings across reboots

### Simplify3D Profile Features

Profile for PLA filament. Change the following parameters value according to your needs:
- Extruder tab
  - Extrusion Width Manual: typically 0,40 or 0,50
- Layer tab
  - Primary Layer Height: typically 0,10, 0,15, 0,20 etc.
  - Top Solid Layers: depending on Primary Layer Height. E.g. with a 0,15 height, set to 10 to have a 1,5 mm solid layer
  Bottom Solid Layers: depending on Primary Layer Height. E.g. with a 0,15 height, set to 10 to have a 1,5 mm solid layer
  Outline/Perimeters Shells: depending on Extrusion Width. E.g. with a 0,50 width, set to 3 to have a 1,5 mm perimeters shells
  - First Layer Height: set to a value greater than 100% to have a first layer taller than Primary Layer Height and viceversa
  - First Layer Width: set to a value greater than 100% to have a first layer wider than Extrusion Width and viceversa
  - First Layer Speed: set to a value greater than 100% to have a speed bigger than Default Printing Speed and viceversa
